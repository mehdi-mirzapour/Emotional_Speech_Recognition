## Abstract

This work explores a novel approach to **emotional speech recognition (ESR)** by leveraging **pre-trained deep visual models**. Instead of traditional speech processing methods, the technique involves:

- Converting **acoustic features into image representations**.
- Utilizing **pre-trained deep learning models** (such as VGG-16) designed for **computer vision** to classify emotions.
- Demonstrating **state-of-the-art results** on the **Berlin EMO-DB dataset**.

Stay tuned for the code implementation! ðŸš€
